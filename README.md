🚀 Excited to Share My First Excel Dashboard Project! 📊
I've just completed a Customer Center Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel, designed to monitor and visualize customer service performance across regions and time periods.
🔧 Key Features of the Dashboard:

📈 Trend Line: Monthly call volume patterns
📊 Bar Charts: Performance by Agent and Region
🕹️ Slicers: Interactive filters for Representatives
During the process I faced issues like 
🛠️ Challenges like aligning visuals and managing slicers
